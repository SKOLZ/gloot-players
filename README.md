# Players - G-Loot

## Introduction

In the root folder you'll find the whole React app and a folder named `frontend-assignment` which conatains the API provided by G-Loot with a slight change to fix a CORS error in the PUT and DELETE methods.


## Instalation

To run run the project you'll have to open the `frontend-assignment` folder in a separate terminal and run:
```
npm i
npm start
```
That will leave the API running at `localhost:3000`.

After that from the root folder you have to run:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
That will run the React application which will most likely be running at `localhost:5173`.
